# MkDocs Common

MkDocs is quite some to adopt and deploy into production.

## Commands

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server, serving at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
* `mkdocs gh-deploy -c` - Build and deploy to Github pages, on the branch gh-pages. You do need to do some configuration for this.
